# Statistics-and-R

In the module, AutosRUs’ newest prototype, the MechaCar, is suffering from production troubles. There are a number of issues surrounding the vehicle’s specifications and manufacturing process that are blocking the manufacturing team from proceeding.
And to help analyze the production data in order to justify some last-minute design decisions with the following two datasets:
1) The results of an mpg testing dataset of 50 potential prototype MechaCars. The MechaCar prototypes were produced using multiple design specifications to identify ideal vehicle performance. Multiple metrics such as vehicle length, vehicle weight, spoiler angle, drivetrain, and ground clearance were collected for each vehicle.
2) MechaCar suspension coil test results from multiple production lots. In this dataset, the weight capacity of multiple suspension coils were tested to determine if the manufacturing process is consistent across lots.

By combining his understanding of R and statistics with the manufacturing datasets provided, I created a robust technical report. Technical reports are common in product development and are used to justify design choices using quantitative and qualitative reasoning.

The goals of this challenge are for me to complete the following:

Design and interpret a multiple linear regression analysis to identify variables of interest.
Calculate summary statistics for quantitative variables.
Perform a t-test in R and provide interpretation of results.
Design your own statistical study to compare vehicle performance of two vehicles.
